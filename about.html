<div class="about">
    <div class="card">
        <p>The societal initiative to establish a higher education and scientific institution in the field of mathematical and physical sciences was officially formalized in 1970, when the Assembly of the Socialist Republic of Montenegro adopted the Development Program of Higher Education Institutions in Montenegro for the period 1971–1975. The concept of such an institution was not yet fully defined at that time, so the Program mentioned two possible names: the Institute for Mathematics and Its Applications and the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics. In the Development Program of the "Veljko Vlahović" University for the period 1976–1980, the institution's structure was more clearly outlined, emphasizing the need to establish an Institute of Natural Sciences as a joint educational and scientific unit within the University.</p>

    <div class="card">
        <p>Alongside the development of the Technical Faculty in Titograd, its Department of Mathematics and Physics also strengthened in terms of personnel. As a result, following the transformation of the Technical Faculty—socially validated on July 14, 1978—the Institute for Mathematics and Physics was established as the first step in implementing the University’s Development Program.</p>

    <div class="card">
        <p>On April 7, 1980, approval was granted for the curriculum of the Department of Mathematics and the Department of Physics. The first generation of students in these departments enrolled in the 1980/81 academic year.</p>

    <div class="card">
        <p>On May 17, 1988, the Institute for Mathematics and Physics was officially renamed the Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics (PMF), and the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science was restructured.</p>

    <br>
    <div class="card">
        <p>A significant milestone in the development of PMF was the establishment of the Department of Biology, with its first student generation enrolled in the 1991/92 academic year.</p>

    <br>
    <div class="card">
        <p>In the 2001/02 academic year, the Computer Science study program was launched within the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, followed by the Applied Study Program “Higher (later Advanced) School of Computer Science and Information Technology” the next year.</p>
    </div>    
    <br>
    <div class="card">
        <p>Since the 2004/2005 academic year, teaching at the faculty has been organized in accordance with the unified European education system, in line with the Bologna Declaration. In 2007, a comprehensive reorganization of study programs at PMF was carried out.</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="card">
        <p>For about ten years, the University Computer Center (URC) operated as a separate organizational unit within PMF. Its mission was to support teaching and scientific research at the University of Montenegro in the field of computer science. Today, PMF operates its own Computer Center as a distinct organizational unit, which supports teaching and research at the Faculty in computer science and provides services to third parties.</p>
